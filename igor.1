\f(CR\-set_wd /path/to/dir/\fP
T}:T{
.sp
Sets the working directory to \fI/path/to/dir/\fP,
default is \fI/tmp\fP. \fB This should be an already existing directory and
will not be created by IGoR \fP
T}
T{

.sp
Sets the number of OpenMP threads to \fIN\fP for alignments
and inference/evaluation. By default IGoR will use the maximum number of
threads.

\f(CR\-read_seqs /path/to/file\fP
T}:T{
.sp
Reads the input sequences file
\fI/path/to/file\fP and reformat it in the working directory. \fBThis step is
necessary for running any action on sequences using the command line\fP.
Can be a fasta file, a csv file (with the sequence index as first column
and the sequence in the second separated by a semicolon \fI;\fP) or a text
file with one sequence per line (format recognition is based on the file
extension). Providing this file will create a semicolon separated file
with indexed sequences in the \fIalign\fP folder.
T}

\f(CR\-batch batchname\fP
T}:T{
.sp
Sets the batch name. This name will be used as a
prefix to alignment/indexed sequences files, output, infer, evaluate and
generate folders.
T}
T{
.sp
\f(CR\-chain chainname\fP
T}:T{
.sp
Selects a model and a set of genomic template
according to the value. Possible values for \f(CRchainname\fP are: \f(CRalpha\fP,
\f(CRbeta\fP, \f(CRlight\fP, \f(CRheavy_naive\fP, and \f(CRheavy_memory\fP. \fBThis needs to be
set in order to use provided genomic templates/model\fP
T}
T{

\f(CR\-species speciesname\fP
T}:T{
.sp
Selects a species from the set of predefined
species. Possible values are: \f(CRhuman\fP.\fBThis needs to be set in order to
use provided genomic templates/model\fP
T}
T{
.sp
\f(CR\-set_genomic \-\-*gene* /path/to/file.fasta\fP
T}:T{
.sp
Set a set of custom
genomic templates for gene \fIgene\fP (possible values are \-\-V,\-\-D and \-\-J)
with a list of genomic templates contained in the file
\fI/path/to/file.fasta\fP in fasta format. If the set of provided genomic
templates is already fully contained (same name and same sequence) in
the loaded model (default, custom, last_inferred), the missing ones will
be set to zero probability keeping the ratios of the others. For
instance providing only one already known genomic template will result
in a model with the considered gene usage to be 1.0, all others set to
0.0. \fBWhen using this option and introducing new/modified genomic
templates, the user will need to re\-infer a model since the genomic
templates will no longer correspond to the ones contained in the
reference models, the model parameters are thus automatically reset to a
uniform distribution.\fP
T}
T{
.sp
\f(CR\-set_CDR3_anchors \-\-*gene*\fP
T}:T{
.sp
Load a semicolon separated file containing the indices/offset of
the CDR3 anchors for the \fIgene\fP(\-\-V or \-\-J). The index should correspond
to the first letter of the cysteine (for V) or tryptophan/phenylalanin
(for J) for the nucleotide sequence of the gene. Indices are 0 based.
T}
T{
.sp
\f(CR\-set_custom_model /path/to/model_parms.txt /path/to/model_marginals.txt\fP
T}:T{
.sp
Use a custom model as a baseline for inference or evaluation. \fBNote
that this will override custom genomic templates for inference and
evaluation\fP. Alternatively, providing only the model parameters file
will lead IGoR to create model marginals initialized to a uniform
distribution.
T}
T{
.sp
\f(CR\-load_last_inferred\fP
T}:T{
.sp
Using this command will load the last inferred
model (folder \fIinference/final_xx.txt\fP) as a basis for a new inference,
evaluation or generation of synthetic sequences
T}
T{

Runs the demo code on 300 sequences of 60bp TCRs (mostly a
sanity run check)
T}
T{
.sp
\f(CR\-run_custom\fP
T}:T{
.sp
Runs the code inside the custom section of the main.cpp
file
T}
T{
.sp
\f(CR\-subsample N\fP
T}:T{
.sp
Perform actions on a random subsample of \fIN\fP sequences.
\fBThis flag will have different effects depending on the supplied
commands:\fP if the \f(CR\-read_seqs\fP command is used, the resulting indexed
sequence file will be a subsample of sequences contained in the original
file. Else, if the \f(CR\-align\fP command is used the alignments will be
performed on a subsample of the indexed sequences. Else, if the
\f(CR\-evaluate\fP or \f(CR\-infer\fP command is used the inference will be run on a
subsample of the indexed sequences. \fIObviously N should be < to the
total number of sequences available. The \f(CR\-subsample\fP flag should be
used in only one command of a pipeline, see the Command example section
for details.\fP

.sp
.SS "Alignment commands summary"
.sp
Alignment of the sequences is performed upon detection of the \f(CR\-align\fP
switch in the command line. For each gene, alignment parameters can be
set using \f(CR\-\-V\fP,\f(CR\-\-D\fP or \f(CR\-\-J\fP. \fBSpecifying any of those three argument
will cause to align only the specified genes\fP. In order to specify a set
of parameters for all genes or force to align all genes the argument
\f(CR\-\-all\fP should be passed.
.sp
The complementarity\-determining region (CDR3) of the aligned sequences is
by default written on a file <batchname>_indexed_CDR3.csv in the aligns
directory when \f(CR\-\-all\fP is used. In case of separated alignments the CDR3 file
can be generated by using the \f(CR\-\-feature \-\-\-ntCDR3\fP option.
.sp
The arguments for setting the different
parameters are given in the table below.
If the considered sequences are nucleotide CDR3 sequences (delimited by
its anchors on 3\(aq and 5\(aq sides) using the command \f(CR\-\-ntCDR3\fP alignments will
be performed using gene anchors information as offset bounds.

alignments to \fIX\fP. Default is 50.0 for V, 15.0 for D and 15.0 for J
T}
T{
.sp
\f(CR\-\-\-matrix path/to/file\fP
T}:T{
.sp
Sets the substitution matrix to the one given
in the file. Must be \fI\(aq,\(aq\fP delimited. Default is a NUC44 matrix with
stronger penalty on errors (5,\-14)

.sp
Sets the alignment gap penalty to X. Default is
50.0

\f(CR\-\-\-best_align_only\fP
T}:T{
.sp
If \fItrue\fP only keep the best alignment for each gene/allele.
If \fIfalse\fP outputs all alignments above the score threshold. Default is
\fItrue\fP for V and J, and \fIfalse\fP for D.
T}
T{
.sp
\f(CR\-\-\-best_gene_only\fP
T}:T{
.sp
If \fItrue\fP only keep alignments for best scoring gene candidate
(or candidates if several genes have the same maximum score).
If \fIfalse\fP outputs alignments for every aligned gene/allele. Default is
\fIfalse\fP for V, D and J.
T}
T{
.sp
\f(CR\-\-\-offset_bounds M N\fP
T}:T{
.sp
Constrains the possible positions of the
alignments. The offset is defined as the position on the read to which
the first nucleotide of the genomic template aligns (can be negative,
e.g for V for which most of the V is on the 5\(aq of the read and cannot be
seen). Default values are \-inf and +inf. If the \f(CR\-\-ntCDR3\fP command has been given
provided offset bounds values will be used for genes with missing CDR3 anchors positions.
T}
T{
.sp
\f(CR\-\-\-template_spec_offset_bounds path/to/file\fP
T}:T{
.sp
Constrains the possible positions of the
alignments differently for each genomic template. The file should be a semi colon separated
file formated as follows: \f(CRgene_name;min_offset;max_offset\fP.
If entries are missing for some genes, values given with the \f(CR\-\-\-offset_bounds\fP command
will be used. If the \f(CR\-\-ntCDR3\fP command has been given provided template specific offset bounds
values will be used for genes with missing CDR3 anchors positions. If non template specific entry
is given for the considered gene, general offset bounds values will be used.
T}
T{
.sp
\f(CR\-\-\-reversed_offsets\fP
T}:T{
.sp
If \fItrue\fP provided offsets are accounted for reversed offsets.
Reversed offsets are defined relative to the last nucleotide of the read instead of the first. Reversed offsets must be \(lA0 by construction.

.SS "Inference and evaluation commands"
.sp
The inference is reached using the command \f(CR\-infer\fP. Logs and models
parameters values for each iteration will be created in the folder
\fIinference\fP of the working directory (or \fIbatchname_inference\fP if a
batchname was supplied).
.sp
Sequence evaluation is reached using the command \f(CR\-evaluate\fP. This is
the same as performing an iteration of the Expectation\-Maximization on
the whole dataset and thus accepts the same arguments as \f(CR\-infer\fP for
arguments related to the precision of the algorithm. The logs of the
sequences evaluation are created in the folder \fIevaluate\fP (or
\fIbatchname_evaluate\fP if a batchname was supplied).

Sets the probability ratio threshold to X. This

means exploring every possible scenario (exact but very slow), while
setting it to 1.0 only explores scenarios that are more likely than the
best scenario explored so far (very fast but inaccurate). This sets a
trade off between speed and accuracy, the best value is the largest one
for which the likelihood of the sequences almost doesn\(cqt change when
decreasing it further.

.SS "Outputs"
.sp
Outputs or Counters in the C++ interface are scenario/sequence
statistics, each individually presented below. They are all written in
the \fIoutput\fP folder (or \fIbatchname_output\fP if a batchname was supplied).
.sp
In order to specify outputs use the \f(CR\-output\fP argument, and detail the
desired list of outputs. Outputs are tied to the exploration of
scenarios and thus require to have \f(CR\-infer\fP or \f(CR\-evaluate\fP in the same
command. Note that although it might be interesting to track some
outputs during the inference for debugging purposes, best practice would
be to use it along with evaluation.
.sp
The different outputs are detailed in the next sections.
.sp
Python utility functions are provided to analyze these outputs in the
\f(CRpygor.counters\fP submodule.
.SS "Best scenarios"
.sp
\fIOutput the N best scenarios for each sequence\fP
.sp
Use command \f(CR\-\-scenarios N\fP
.sp
The output of this Counter is a semicolon separated values file with one
field for each event realization, associated mismatches/errors/mutations
indices on the read, the scenario rank, its associated probability and
the sequence index.
Python functions to parse the output of the Best scenario counter can be
found in the \f(CRpygor.counters.bestscenarios\fP submodule.
.SS "Generation probability"
.sp
\fIEstimates the probability of generation of the error free/unmutated
ancestor sequence\fP By default only outputs an estimator of the
probability of generation of the ancestor sequence underlying each
sequencing read. See
.URL "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467\-018\-02832\-w" "IGoR\(cqs paper" " "
for
details.
.sp
Use command \f(CR\-\-Pgen\fP
.SS "Coverage"
.sp
\fICounts for each genomic nucleotide how many times it has been seen and
how many times it was mutated/erroneous\fP
.sp
Use command \f(CR\-\-coverage\fP
.SS "Sequence generation commands"

IGoR is a C++ software designed to infer V(D)J recombination related
processes from sequencing data such as:

* Recombination model probability distribution
* Hypermutation model
* Best candidates recombination scenarios
* Generation probabilities of sequences (even hypermutated)

The following article describes the methodology, performance tests and
some new biological results obtained with IGoR:

immune repertoire analysis with IGoR_], _Nature Communications_, (2018)

Its heavily object oriented and modular style was designed to ensure
long term support and evolvability for new tasks in assessing TCR and
BCR receptors features using modern parallel architectures.

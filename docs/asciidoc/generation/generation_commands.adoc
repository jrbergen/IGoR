Sequence generation commands
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Reached using the command `-generate N` where _N_ is the number of
sequences to be generated. The number of sequences to generate must be
passed before optional arguments. Optional parameters are the following:

[width="99%",cols="<32%,<68%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Command line argument |Description
|`--noerr` |Generate sequences without sequencing error (the rate and
the way those errors are generated is controlled by the model error
rate)

|Â `--CDR3` |Outputs nucleotide CDR3 from generated sequences. The file
contains three fields: CDR3 nucleotide sequence, whether the CDR3
anchors were found (if erroneous/mutated) and whether the sequence is
inframe or not. Gene anchors are not yet defined for all the default
models shipped with IGoR, use `-set_CDR3_anchors` to set them.

|`--name myname` |Prefix for the generated sequences filenames. *Note
that setting the _batchname_ will change the generated sequences folder
name, while setting _--name_ will change the file names.*

|`--seed X` |Impose _X_ as a seed for the random sequence generator. By
default a random seed is obtained from the system.

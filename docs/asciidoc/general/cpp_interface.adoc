Although a few command line options are supplied for basic use of IGoR,
its full modularity can be used through high level C++ functions on
which all previous command lines are built. A section of the _main.cpp_
file is dedicated to accept user supplied code and can be executed using
the `-run_custom` command line argument when launching IGoR from the
shell. An example of the high level workflow is given in the _run demo_
section and the full Doxygen generated documentation is available as
PDF. For any question please contact us.

Good practice would be to append the C++ code in the dedicated area of the
 _main.cpp_ file:
[source,cpp,indent=0]
----
	else{
		//Write your custom procedure here
        // <1>
	}
----
<1> Insert you custom code here.


This part of the code is reachable using the `-run_custom` command line argument. 
This design aims at keeping the command line interface fully functional while
still appending some custom code.

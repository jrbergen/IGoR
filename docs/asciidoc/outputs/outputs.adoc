Outputs
~~~~~~~

Outputs or Counters in the C++ interface are scenario/sequence
statistics, each individually presented below. They are all written in
the _output_ folder (or _batchname_output_ if a batchname was supplied).

In order to specify outputs use the `-output` argument, and detail the
desired list of outputs. Outputs are tied to the exploration of
scenarios and thus require to have `-infer` or `-evaluate` in the same
command. Note that although it might be interesting to track some
outputs during the inference for debugging purposes, best practice would
be to use it along with evaluation.

The different outputs are detailed in the next sections.

Python utility functions are provided to analyze these outputs in the
`pygor.counters` submodule.

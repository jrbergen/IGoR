Best scenarios
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

_Output the N best scenarios for each sequence_

Use command `--scenarios N`

The output of this Counter is a semicolon separated values file with one
field for each event realization, associated mismatches/errors/mutations
indices on the read, the scenario rank, its associated probability and
the sequence index.
Python functions to parse the output of the Best scenario counter can be
found in the `pygor.counters.bestscenarios` submodule.
